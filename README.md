hangman
===========

Python console version of hangman. You'll need to download the "words.txt" file as well, and update the variable "address" at the bottom of the file to the correct path.

This is a text-based version of hangman. Works with standard Python libraries (no other installs needed) and was built using Python 2.7.2.

It will allow you to play a game, and then ask if you'd like to play another or not.
